		Yeah it's a game inspired by Undertale ! To win this game you need to go on all the lasers, arrows and skull with your soul (the red heart, idiot) !
		Ahah it was a joke dude ;) ... It's not funny ? Ah ok... Sorry. Hum Okay, you need to dodge all the crap that comes to you, easy, right?
		So use the mouse for that. Well, afterwards, you'll be against the boss. There, your soul will transform, at this moment you can shoot a super laser (* cough * a shit laser especially) by clicking on your mouse.
		You talk about an info ... Well, it's time to play. See ya!</p></div>
